# tmpmail

Disposable email for scripts, tests and AI agents. Make an address, sign up with it, and
get the verification code back in one line of shell. When one provider is down, tmpmail
[moves on to the next](#choose-the-provider).

<sub>A real mail, sent to the new address by
[`assets/demo/send-test-mail.py`](assets/demo/send-test-mail.py) and delivered over
mail.tm's push stream. Recorded with [vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) from
[`assets/demo/demo.tape`](assets/demo/demo.tape).</sub>

## Install

```sh
cargo install tmpmail
```

With [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall), `cargo binstall tmpmail`
downloads the prebuilt binary instead of compiling. On macOS or Linux with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install qorvyx/tap/tmpmail
```

Use the full name: Homebrew's own `tmpmail` is a different project.

Or take a prebuilt binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/qorvyx/tmpmail/releases/latest):
Linux (x86_64, aarch64, fully static), macOS (Intel, Apple silicon) and Windows (x64, C
runtime linked in, so no Visual C++ Redistributable needed since 0.3.1). Each release has
`SHA256SUMS`, and every file carries a GitHub build attestation that proves it was built
from this repository by the release workflow:

```sh
gh attestation verify tmpmail-0.3.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz --repo qorvyx/tmpmail
```

Nothing else is needed at runtime. Optional extras: `wl-copy`, `xclip`, `xsel` or `pbcopy`
for `copy` (Windows has `clip.exe`), a browser for `read --html` (found through `xdg-open`,
`open`, or Explorer on Windows), `notify-send` for `watch --notify` (macOS uses `osascript`,
Windows a PowerShell toast), and `less` for long messages (without it, Windows prints them).
Colors work in the classic `cmd.exe` console too (Windows 10 and later). CI runs the tests on Linux, macOS and Windows.

Rather have a window? The [desktop app](#desktop-app-preview) is in preview.

## Use it

### In a script or CI

`wait` blocks until a matching mail arrives. `otp` prints just the code and `links` just
the links, verification links first. Every command takes `--json`, and exit codes tell a
timeout (2) apart from a dead provider (3).

```sh
addr=$(tmpmail new -q)
./signup.sh "$addr"
code=$(tmpmail otp --wait --include-existing --from 'acme' --timeout 120)
link=$(tmpmail wait --link --include-existing --subject 'confirm')
tmpmail --json ls | jq -r '.messages[0].subject'
```

`--include-existing` matters when the mail can arrive before `wait` starts. Without it,
`wait` only accepts mail that is new since the call. In GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Install tmpmail
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    curl -sSfL https://github.com/qorvyx/tmpmail/releases/download/v0.3.1/tmpmail-0.3.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz \
      | tar xz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.local/bin tmpmail-0.3.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/tmpmail
    echo "$HOME/.local/bin" >> "$GITHUB_PATH"

- name: Sign-up test
  run: |
    addr=$(tmpmail new -q)
    curl -sSf https://staging.example.com/signup -d "email=$addr"
    code=$(tmpmail otp --wait --include-existing --timeout 120)
    curl -sSf https://staging.example.com/verify -d "email=$addr" -d "code=$code"
```

The [daily provider check](.github/workflows/providers.yml) creates and lists inboxes from
GitHub's Linux, macOS and Windows runners, so the free providers are known to work from CI.
Its badge turns red only when every provider is down from one of them.

### With an AI agent

`tmpmail mcp` is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server. An agent
can create an inbox, sign up somewhere and fetch the code without you:

```sh
claude mcp add tmpmail -- tmpmail mcp
```

Other clients take `{ "command": "tmpmail", "args": ["mcp"] }`. The tools are
`create_inbox`, `list_inboxes`, `list_messages`, `read_message`, `wait_for_message`,
`get_verification_code`, `get_links`, `delete_message` and `delete_inbox`. Waits run in
parallel and can be cancelled. Anyone can mail a temp address, so treat what the agent reads
there as untrusted input. [Details](docs/usage.md#mcp-server-for-ai-agents).

### In the terminal

`tmpmail tui` shows your inboxes, their mail and a preview, updated as mail arrives. A
verification code is highlighted, and `y` copies it.

![The tmpmail TUI receiving a mail live and copying its code](assets/tui.gif)

The [guide](#guide) below shows each feature in a few lines, and [all commands](#commands)
are listed under Reference.

### Desktop app (preview)

For people who'd rather not live in a terminal, tmpmail also comes as a desktop app for
Linux, macOS and Windows, on the same inboxes and `config.toml` as the CLI. It shows your
inboxes and their mail live, puts the verification code in a big banner with a Copy button,
lists the verification link first, previews HTML mail safely (light or dark), saves
attachments (or drags them out on Linux and macOS), and creates and deletes inboxes and
messages, with the TUI's keyboard shortcuts. It notifies you of new mail (with the code, if
there is one) while it's in the background, can sit in the tray and keep checking with the
window closed, and has a settings screen. [More](gui/README.md).

![The tmpmail desktop app showing a verification code in a banner above the mail](assets/desktop.png)

<sub>Sample mail.</sub>

It is a **preview**: tested on Linux, built and security-probed in CI on macOS and Windows,
but not yet tried there by hand. Downloads are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/qorvyx/tmpmail/releases), under the `gui-v*` releases
(`https://github.com/qorvyx/tmpmail/releases/download/gui-vVERSION/FILE`), each with
`SHA256SUMS` and a build attestation (`gh attestation verify FILE --repo qorvyx/tmpmail`):

| System | File |
|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 (x64) | `tmpmail-desktop-VERSION-x64-setup.exe` |
| macOS 10.15+ (Apple silicon and Intel) | `tmpmail-desktop-VERSION-universal.dmg` |
| Debian, Ubuntu (x86_64) | `tmpmail-desktop-VERSION-amd64.deb` |
| Fedora and other RPM-based (x86_64) | `tmpmail-desktop-VERSION-x86_64.rpm` |
| Other Linux (x86_64) | `tmpmail-desktop-VERSION-x86_64.AppImage` |

The app isn't signed with a paid certificate, so each system warns once:

- **macOS:** open the DMG and drag tmpmail to Applications. Open it once; macOS refuses.
  Then go to System Settings → Privacy & Security, click **Open Anyway** next to the
  message about tmpmail, and enter your password. On macOS 15 (Sequoia) and later,
  Control-click → Open no longer skips this. If you trust the download,
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/tmpmail.app` does the same from a terminal.
- **Windows:** SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC": click **More info**, then
  **Run anyway**. The installer installs for your user only (no admin prompt) and fetches
  WebView2 if it's missing. **Smart App Control blocks it outright**, with no way past for
  one app; it can only be turned off as a whole.
- **Linux:** `sudo apt install ./tmpmail-desktop-VERSION-amd64.deb` or
  `sudo dnf install ./tmpmail-desktop-VERSION-x86_64.rpm` (both pull in WebKitGTK 4.1), or
  `chmod +x` the AppImage and run it (it may need `libfuse2`; without FUSE, add
  `--appimage-extract-and-run`). On NVIDIA, if the window stays blank, start it with
  `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`.

If you use the CLI too, use **tmpmail 0.3.0 or later**: the app's settings screen can write
the `http_timeout` key, which 0.2.0 refuses (0.3.0 and later warn about keys they don't
know). To run the app from source instead, with Rust 1.90+, Node 24 and pnpm:

```sh
cd gui && pnpm install && pnpm tauri dev
```

### Coming from the original tmpmail

[sdushantha/tmpmail](https://github.com/sdushantha/tmpmail) was a shell script on a single
backend, 1secmail, which has shut down. This is a rewrite in Rust, and the old interface
still works: `tmpmail -g [ADDR]`, `tmpmail`, `tmpmail -r`, `tmpmail ID`, `-d`, `-c`, `-t`.
It no longer needs `w3m`, `curl` or `jq`.
[Mapping of the old flags](docs/usage.md#original-tmpmail-flags).

## Guide

Each part is a plain explanation and the commands for it. The [provider table](#providers)
shows which services support what.

### Create an address

```sh
tmpmail new              # random, readable address, e.g. quickfox605@maxxspace.com
tmpmail new -c           # same, and copy it to the clipboard
tmpmail whoami           # show it again later
```

The new address becomes the *active* inbox: every other command uses it unless you say
otherwise (see [several inboxes](#several-inboxes)).

### Choose the username

The part before `@` is random by default. Pick your own with `-u`, or give the whole
address:

```sh
tmpmail new -u otter42
tmpmail new otter42@maxxspace.com
```

Works on mail.tm, mail.gw, Guerrilla Mail and Maildrop; `tmpmail new` skips the providers
that can't do it.

### Pick a domain

The part after `@`. List the domains a provider offers, then ask for one:

```sh
tmpmail domains                  # mail.tm's domains
tmpmail domains -p dropmail      # DropMail's (about 20 of them)
tmpmail new -d yomail.info       # tmpmail finds the provider that has it
```

Useful when a site blocks one disposable domain: try another. Works on mail.tm, mail.gw,
DropMail and Guerrilla Mail.

### Choose the provider

`tmpmail new` tries the providers in order (`mailtm, dropmail, guerrilla, tempmail_lol,
mailgw`) and uses the first one that works, telling you if it had to skip one. To use one
in particular, or change the order:

```sh
tmpmail new -p guerrilla             # only Guerrilla Mail, no fallback
tmpmail providers --check            # which ones are up right now
TMPMAIL_PROVIDER=dropmail,mailtm tmpmail new
```

The order can also be set for good in the [config file](#configuration).
In the TUI, `N` picks the provider.

### Read your mail

```sh
tmpmail                  # list messages, newest first (same as tmpmail ls)
tmpmail read 1           # read the newest; long ones open in a pager
tmpmail read 1 --html    # the HTML version in your browser, sanitized, no remote images
```

A message can be named by its number in the list, its id, or the first characters of its
id. With no number, commands use the newest message.

### Wait for a code or link

```sh
tmpmail otp --wait                    # wait for a new mail with a code, print the code
tmpmail wait --link --from github     # wait for a mail from GitHub, print its best link
tmpmail otp 1                         # the code in a message you already have
tmpmail links 1                       # every link in it, verification links first
```

Waiting gives up after 180 seconds (`-t` to change it) with exit code 2. It only accepts
mail that arrives after you start; add `--include-existing` if the mail may already be
there. `--from`, `--subject` and `--body` narrow it down, and plain words work.

### Live push

With mail.tm and DropMail, tmpmail keeps a connection open and the provider announces new
mail the moment it lands, so `wait`, `watch` and the TUI react in about a second. Other
providers are checked every 5 seconds. The TUI shows `● live` while the connection is up.
Nothing to set up; turn it off with `TMPMAIL_PUSH=0` or `push = false` in the config.

### Attachments

```sh
tmpmail attachments 1                 # list them
tmpmail save 1 -o ~/Downloads         # download all of them
tmpmail save 1 invoice.pdf            # or just one
```

File names are cleaned up and existing files are never overwritten. Works on mail.tm,
mail.gw, DropMail and Guerrilla Mail.

### Several inboxes

Give inboxes labels and switch between them by label, address, or the part before `@`:

```sh
tmpmail new -l github
tmpmail new -l shop
tmpmail inboxes                       # all of them, with expiry; * = active
tmpmail -i github ls                  # one command on another inbox
tmpmail use shop                      # make it the active one
tmpmail ls -a                         # mail in every inbox
tmpmail otp --wait -a                 # a code arriving at any of them
```

### Log back in

mail.tm and mail.gw inboxes are real accounts that last until you delete them. Set a
password to use one elsewhere, or log in to an account you made on their website:

```sh
tmpmail new -p mailtm --password 'correct horse'   # then log in on mail.tm with it
tmpmail login otter42@maxxspace.com --password 'correct horse'
```

DropMail sessions expire when idle. tmpmail brings the same address back automatically the
next time you use it, but mail from the expired session is gone. Guerrilla Mail sessions
are re-attached to the same address the same way. Maildrop
inboxes are public, so `tmpmail login name@maildrop.cc` needs no password.

### Clean up

```sh
tmpmail delete 1                      # delete one message
tmpmail delete --all                  # every message in the inbox
tmpmail drop                          # delete the inbox at the provider and forget it
tmpmail rotate                        # swap the active address for a fresh one
tmpmail watch --rotate 30m            # a fresh address every 30 minutes
tmpmail inboxes --prune               # forget inboxes that have expired
```

Deleting messages works on mail.tm, mail.gw, Guerrilla Mail and Maildrop.

## Providers

| Provider | Lifetime | [Username](#choose-the-username) | [Domain](#pick-a-domain) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [Push](#live-push) | [Delete](#clean-up) | [Log back in](#log-back-in) |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| [mail.tm](https://mail.tm) `mailtm` | until deleted; mail kept 7 days | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | password |
| [DropMail.me](https://dropmail.me) `dropmail` | renewed while used | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | automatic |
| [Guerrilla Mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com) `guerrilla` | mail kept 60 min | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | automatic |
| [tempmail.lol](https://tempmail.lol) `tempmail_lol` | 1 hour | | | | | | |
| [mail.gw](https://mail.gw) `mailgw` | until deleted; mail kept 7 days | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | password |
| [Maildrop](https://maildrop.cc) `maildrop` | 24 h without mail | ✓ | | | | ✓ | by name |

- **Maildrop is public**: anyone who guesses the name can read the inbox. It is never used
  unless you ask for it with `-p maildrop`, and its first mail may be delayed by greylisting.
- **tempmail.lol** is the last resort: no attachments, and a mail with a text attachment
  arrives with the attachment in place of its body.
- **mail.gw** runs the same software as mail.tm and is tried last.

How tmpmail picks one is under [choose the provider](#choose-the-provider). Only documented
APIs are used. Many sites block known disposable domains; [another domain](#pick-a-domain)
or provider usually gets through.

Thanks to **mail.tm** for its free API; per its terms this client links back to it.

</details>

<a id="configuration"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Configuration and environment</b></summary>

`~/.config/tmpmail/config.toml` (or `$TMPMAIL_CONFIG`), all optional:

```toml
providers = ["mailtm", "guerrilla"]   # fallback order for `new`
browser = "firefox"                   # for --html and links --open
clipboard_cmd = "wl-copy"
pager = "less"                        # for long messages in `read` (default $PAGER, else less)
poll_interval = 5                     # seconds, for wait/watch
timeout = 180                         # default wait timeout
push = true                           # live push from mail.tm/DropMail in wait/watch
http_timeout = 20                     # seconds per request to a provider (new in 0.3.0)
```

A key tmpmail doesn't know (a typo, or one from a newer version) is ignored with a warning
on stderr (`-q` and `--json` silence it): tmpmail 0.2.0 and earlier refuse unknown config
keys; 0.3.0 and later warn. A known key with a bad value is still an error.

Environment: `TMPMAIL_PROVIDER` (comma list), `TMPMAIL_TIMEOUT`, `TMPMAIL_POLL_INTERVAL`,
`TMPMAIL_PUSH`, `TMPMAIL_HTTP_TIMEOUT`, `TMPMAIL_INBOX`, `TMPMAIL_PASSWORD`, `TMPMAIL_STATE_DIR`,
`TMPMAIL_DROPMAIL_TOKEN`, `PAGER`, `NO_COLOR`.

</details>

## Privacy and security

- State (addresses and their credentials) lives in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tmpmail/state.json`
  (`~/.local/state/tmpmail`), directory `0700`, file `0600`, never in `/tmp`.
- Message text is stripped of terminal control sequences before printing.
- `read --html` writes a sanitized copy (no scripts, forms, frames; strict CSP) and
  **blocks remote images** (tracking pixels) unless you pass `--images`. These copies are
  deleted after a day.
- Attachment names are sanitized so they can't escape the target directory, and
  existing files are never overwritten.
- `tmpmail mcp` hands message contents to an AI agent. Anyone can mail a temp address, so
  treat what the agent reads there as untrusted input.
- No telemetry. The only network traffic is to the provider you use.

## Development

```sh
cargo test                  # unit tests + provider tests against a mock HTTP server
cargo clippy --all-targets
./scripts/smoke.sh          # live check against the real providers (creates throwaway inboxes)
vhs assets/demo/demo.tape   # re-record the demo (needs vhs, and outbound SMTP for the test mail)
```

The crate is also a library: `tmpmail = { version = "0.3", default-features = false }`
gives the providers, stored inboxes, watcher and mail sanitizing (`tmpmail::provider`,
`tmpmail::store`, `tmpmail::watcher`, ...) without the CLI's dependencies. Its API isn't
stable yet.

The desktop app is in [`gui/`](gui/README.md) (see [Desktop app](#desktop-app-preview)),
with its own `gui-v*` releases.
