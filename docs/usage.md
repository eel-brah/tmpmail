## Basics

**Several inboxes at once.** `ls`, `wait`, `otp --wait` and `watch` accept `-a`
(`--all-inboxes`) to cover every saved inbox instead of just the active one:

```sh
tmpmail ls -a          # check all my addresses
tmpmail wait -a        # block until any of them receives a message
tmpmail watch -a -n    # live feed of all of them, with desktop notifications
```

**Active inbox.** `tmpmail new` creates an address and makes it the *active* inbox. Every
other command works on the active inbox unless you pick another one with `-i`.

**Choosing an inbox** (`-i`, `use`, `drop`). Any of these work:
- the full address: `quietotter482@maxxspace.com`
- the part before `@`: `quietotter482`
- a label you gave it with `-l`: `github`

**Choosing a message** (`read`, `otp`, `links`, `delete`, `save`, `attachments`). Any of these work:
- its number in `tmpmail ls`: `1` is the newest
- its full id: `6aa6c0f1e2...`
- the first few characters of its id, if no other message starts the same way: `6aa6`
- nothing at all, which means the newest message

**Regex options** (`--from`, `--subject`, `--body`, `--match`) take regular expressions and
ignore case. Plain words work: `--from github` matches `GitHub <noreply@github.com>`.

## Global options

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `--json` | | Print machine-readable JSON instead of text (format in [json.md](json.md)). Errors become `{"error":{"kind","message"}}`. |
| `--inbox ADDR` | `-i` | Act on this inbox instead of the active one. Example: `tmpmail -i github ls`. Also settable with `TMPMAIL_INBOX`. |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | Print only the essential result, without hints or status lines. Example: `addr=$(tmpmail new -q)`. |
| `--no-color` | | No bold or dim text. Colors are also off when output is piped or `NO_COLOR` is set. In a Windows console, tmpmail turns on its escape-code processing (off in the classic `cmd.exe` window) and prints without colors if it can't. |
| `--browser CMD` | `-b` | Program used by `read --html` and `links --open`, e.g. `-b firefox` or `-b w3m`. Default: `$BROWSER`, then the system opener: `xdg-open` (Linux), `open` (macOS), `wslview` (WSL), or Explorer's default handler on Windows (started without tmpmail's own handles, so a file its output is redirected to stays free). |
| `--clipboard-cmd CMD` | | Program that receives the address on stdin for `copy` and `--copy`. Default: auto-detects `wl-copy` (Wayland), `xclip`/`xsel` (X11), `pbcopy` (macOS), `clip.exe` (Windows, WSL), `termux-clipboard-set` (Termux). |
| `--help` | `-h` | Help for tmpmail or for one command (`tmpmail wait -h`). |
| `--version` | `-V` | Print the version. |

## Commands

### `new`: create an address

Creates an address, saves it and makes it active. Alias: `generate`. Old flag: `-g`.

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `ADDRESS` | | Full address you want, e.g. `tmpmail new otter42@maxxspace.com`. Same as `-u otter42 -d maxxspace.com`. |
| `--user NAME` | `-u` | The part before `@`. Random and readable by default (`quietotter482`). Only providers that allow choosing it are used: mail.tm, mail.gw, Guerrilla, Maildrop. |
| `--domain DOMAIN` | `-d` | The part after `@`. See `tmpmail domains` for choices. tmpmail asks every provider for its domains at once and goes straight to one that has it, so `-d` works without `-p`. |
| `--provider ID` | `-p` | Use only this provider (no fallback): `mailtm`, `mailgw`, `dropmail`, `guerrilla`, `tempmail_lol`, `maildrop`. |
| `--label NAME` | `-l` | A nickname for the inbox, used later with `-i NAME`. Example: `-l github`. |
| `--password PW` | | Password for the mail.tm/mail.gw account, so you can log in later on the mail.tm website. Random by default. Also `TMPMAIL_PASSWORD`. |
| `--copy` | `-c` | Also copy the new address to the clipboard. |

```sh
tmpmail new                        # random address, first working provider
tmpmail new -u myname -l shop -c   # chosen name, labelled "shop", copied
tmpmail new -p guerrilla           # force Guerrilla Mail
```

### `ls`: list messages

Lists messages, newest first. Alias: `inbox`. Running `tmpmail` with no arguments does the same.
Each line shows the list number, a `*` if the message is unread, its age, the sender and
the subject. `[att]` means the message has attachments.

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `--all-inboxes` | `-a` | List the messages of **every** saved inbox, one section per address. An inbox whose provider is down shows `unavailable: ...` instead of stopping the others. |

### `read`: show a message

Prints the headers and body as text. Alias: `show`. Old flags: `-r` (newest), `tmpmail ID`.

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `ID` | | Which message (number, id or id prefix). Newest if omitted. |
| `--recent` | `-r` | Explicitly the newest message. |
| `--html` | | Open the HTML version in your browser. It is sanitized first: no scripts, forms or frames, links can't track you back. |
| `--images` | | With `--html`: also load remote images. Off by default because they are often tracking pixels that tell the sender you opened the mail. |
| `--raw` | | Print the full raw email source (headers + MIME). Useful for debugging or `> mail.eml`. |
| `--no-pager` | | Print a long message straight to the terminal. By default a message taller than the terminal opens in a pager: `pager` from the config, else `$PAGER`, else `less`. On Windows, if neither is set and `less` isn't installed, the message is printed instead. |

### `wait`: wait for a message

Blocks until a **new** message that matches arrives, prints it and exits 0. If nothing
arrives in time it exits with code 2. Built for scripts and CI.

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `--all-inboxes` | `-a` | Wait on **every** saved inbox at once. The first matching message in any of them wins, and tmpmail tells you which address received it. Can't be combined with `-i`. |
| `--from RE` | | Only messages whose sender matches, e.g. `--from github`. |
| `--subject RE` | | Only messages whose subject matches, e.g. `--subject 'verify\|confirm'`. |
| `--body RE` | | Only messages whose body matches. |
| `--timeout SECONDS` | `-t` | Give up after this long. Default 180 (or `timeout` in config / `TMPMAIL_TIMEOUT`). |
| `--interval SECONDS` | | Time between inbox checks. Default 5, minimum 2. With push (see below) checks are rarer, since the provider announces new mail. |
| `--include-existing` | | Also accept a message that was already in the inbox before you started waiting. |
| `--otp` | | Print only the verification code, and keep waiting until a message that contains one arrives. |
| `--otp-regex RE` | | With `--otp`: your own pattern; the first `( )` group is the code. Example: `--otp-regex 'PIN: (\d+)'`. |
| `--link` | | Print only the best link (verification links first). |
| `--delete` | | Delete the message after printing it. |

```sh
code=$(tmpmail wait --otp --from github -t 120)
tmpmail wait -a                     # until any of my inboxes gets mail
tmpmail wait -a --otp -t 600        # a code arriving at any of my inboxes
```

**Push.** For mail.tm and DropMail inboxes, `wait` and `watch` also keep a connection open
over which the provider announces new mail (mail.tm's Mercure server-sent events, DropMail's
`sessionMailReceived` subscription). New mail then shows up within a second or so, instead of
at the next check. While the connection is up, the inbox is still checked once a minute in case
something was missed. If the connection drops, tmpmail goes back to checking every
`--interval` and reconnects with a growing delay. Turn push off with `push = false` in the
config or `TMPMAIL_PUSH=0`.

### `otp`: extract a verification code

Finds the most likely one-time code (e.g. `482913`, `123-456`, `A7K2QX`) in a message.
Years, prices, phone numbers and order numbers are ignored. With `--json` it also lists
the other candidates with their scores.

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `ID` | | Which message. Newest if omitted. |
| `--recent` | `-r` | The newest message. |
| `--regex RE` | | Your own pattern instead of the built-in guess. The first `( )` group is the code. |
| `--wait` | `-w` | Don't read an existing message; wait for a new one that contains a code (same as `wait --otp`). |
| `--all-inboxes`/`-a`, `--from`, `--subject`, `--body`, `--timeout`/`-t`, `--interval`, `--include-existing` | | Same as in `wait`, used with `--wait`. |

### `links`: extract links

Lists every link in a message. Verify, confirm, activate, magic-login and password-reset links
come first. Unsubscribe, social media and image links come last.

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `ID` | | Which message. Newest if omitted. |
| `--recent` | `-r` | The newest message. |
| `--match RE` | `-m` | Keep only links matching this, e.g. `-m confirm`. |
| `--first` | | Print only the best link. |
| `--open` | | Open the best link in the browser. |

### `watch`: live view

Keeps running and prints each new message as it arrives (Ctrl+C to stop). Messages already
there are shown dimmed at start. With `--json` it prints one JSON object per line.

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `--all-inboxes` | `-a` | Watch **every** saved inbox; each line starts with the address that received it. |
| `--notify` | `-n` | Also show a desktop notification for each new message, through `notify-send` (Linux), `osascript` (macOS) or a PowerShell toast (Windows). Nothing is shown if none is available. |
| `--interval SECONDS` | | Time between checks. Default 5. Push applies as in `wait`. |
| `--rotate PERIOD` | | Switch to a fresh address this often, like `rotate` does: `90s`, `30m`, `2h`, `1h30m` (at least `1m`). The new address is printed (and notified with `-n`), becomes active, and is watched from then on. Can't be combined with `-a`. |
| `--keep` | | With `--rotate`: keep the old inboxes instead of dropping them. |
| `--copy` | `-c` | With `--rotate`: copy each new address to the clipboard. |

```sh
tmpmail watch --rotate 30m -c    # a new address every half hour, copied each time
```

### `tui`: full-screen browser

```sh
tmpmail tui          # or: tmpmail -i LABEL tui, to start on that inbox
```

Your inboxes on the left, the selected inbox's mail at the top right and the selected message
below it. Every inbox is checked in the background on the same schedule as `watch` (push on
mail.tm and DropMail, polling elsewhere), so new mail appears on its own; the header shows
`● live` when the selected inbox has a push connection. When a message contains a
verification code, the preview shows it highlighted at the top and `y` copies it.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab`, `←` `→` (`h` `l`), `Enter` | Move between panes |
| `↑` `↓` (`j` `k`), `g` `G` | Move in a list, or scroll the message |
| `PgUp` `PgDn`, `Space` | Scroll the message |
| `n` | Create an inbox (with the same fallback as `new`) |
| `N` | Pick a provider from a list and create an inbox there (no fallback, like `new -p`). Maildrop is marked `public` |
| `a` | Make the selected inbox the active one |
| `c` | Copy the selected inbox's address |
| `D` | Delete the selected inbox (asks first) |
| `y` | Copy the verification code |
| `L` / `O` | Copy / open the message's first link (verification links first) |
| `o` | Open the message's sanitized HTML in the browser, like `read --html` |
| `d` | Delete the message (asks first) |
| `r` | Check the selected inbox now |
| `?` | Show the keys |
| `q`, `Esc`, `Ctrl+C` | Quit (`Esc` steps back a pane first) |

### `attachments`: list attachments

Shows each attachment's id, file name, type and size. Takes `ID` or `--recent`/`-r` like `read`.
Supported by mail.tm, mail.gw, DropMail and Guerrilla.

### `save`: download attachments

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `ID` | | Which message (required). |
| `ATTACHMENTS...` | | Attachment ids or file names to save. All of them if omitted. |
| `--output DIR` | `-o` | Folder to save into. Default: current folder. Existing files are never overwritten; a `(1)` is added instead. |

```sh
tmpmail save 1 -o ~/Downloads
```

### `delete`: delete messages

| Option | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `ID` | The message to delete. |
| `--all` | Delete every message in the inbox. |

Supported by mail.tm, mail.gw, Guerrilla and Maildrop.

### `whoami`: show the address

Prints the active address. `--json` adds provider, label, creation and expiry time.

### `copy`: copy the address

Copies the active address to the clipboard. Old flag: `-c`.

### `qr`: QR code

Draws the active address as a QR code in the terminal, so you can scan it with your phone.

### `domains`: list domains

Lists the domains you can use with `new -d`. Old flag: `-d` (as the first argument).

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `--provider ID` | `-p` | Which provider to ask. Default: the first one in your fallback order (mail.tm). |

### `inboxes`: list your saved inboxes

`*` marks the active one. Shows the label, provider and when it expires.

| Option | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `--prune` | Forget inboxes that have already expired. |

### `use`: switch the active inbox

`tmpmail use github` makes that inbox the default for later commands. `ADDRESS` can be the
address, the local part or the label.

### `login`: attach an existing account

Adds an account you already have, e.g. one created on the mail.tm website or on another machine.

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `ADDRESS` | | The full address. |
| `--password PW` | | Its password (required for mail.tm/mail.gw). Also `TMPMAIL_PASSWORD`. |
| `--provider ID` | `-p` | `mailtm` (default), `mailgw`, or `maildrop` (chosen automatically for `@maildrop.cc`; no password needed). |
| `--label NAME` | `-l` | A nickname, as in `new`. |

### `drop`: delete an inbox

Deletes the inbox at the provider (where possible) and removes it from tmpmail.

| Option | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `ADDRESS` | Which inbox. Default: the active one. |
| `--local` | Only forget it here; leave the account at the provider. |

### `rotate`: get a fresh address

Creates a new address (same provider if it is up), keeps the old label, makes it active,
and drops the old inbox.

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `--keep` | | Keep the old inbox instead of dropping it. |
| `--copy` | `-c` | Copy the new address to the clipboard. |

### `providers`: provider overview

Lists every provider with its position in the fallback order (`#1`… or `--` if not used
by `new`). It also shows what each one supports:
- `PUBLIC`: anyone can read the inbox
- `custom-user`: you can choose the part before `@` (`new -u`)
- `domain`: you can choose the domain (`new -d`)
- `attachments`
- `delete`: messages can be deleted
- `login`: an existing inbox can be attached with `login`
- how long addresses live

| Option | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `--check` | Contact each provider now and show `ok` with the response time, or `DOWN` with the reason. |

### `mcp`: server for AI agents

Runs a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server on stdin/stdout, so
an AI agent can create inboxes and wait for verification mail. Register it with your client,
for example Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add tmpmail -- tmpmail mcp
```

or, in a client's JSON config:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "tmpmail": { "command": "tmpmail", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `create_inbox` | New address, with provider fallback. Optional `provider`, `user`, `domain`, `label`. Does not change your active inbox if you have one. |
| `list_inboxes` | Your saved inboxes, as in `inboxes --json`. |
| `list_messages` | Messages in an inbox, newest first. |
| `read_message` | One message as text, with ranked links and attachment names (`include_html` adds the HTML). |
| `wait_for_message` | Blocks until a message matching `from` / `subject` / `body` (regexes) arrives. |
| `get_verification_code` | The OTP in message `id`, or waits for a message that has one. Optional `regex`. |
| `get_links` | Links in message `id`, or waits for a message with a link matching `match`. |
| `delete_message`, `delete_inbox` | Clean up. |

Every tool takes `inbox` (address, local part or label; default: the active inbox). The waiting
tools take `timeout` (default 120 s, at most 600 s, since clients give up on long calls) and
`include_existing`, which is **true** by default here, unlike the CLI: the agent usually
triggers the mail before it calls the tool, and must not miss it. Pass `false` to wait for new
mail only.

Mail comes from anyone who knows the address. The server tells the client to treat message
contents as untrusted data, but an agent that acts on mail can still be steered by it.

Each tool call runs on its own thread, so a long wait doesn't hold up other calls, and a
client's `notifications/cancelled` stops a running wait within a quarter of a second.

### `man`: manual pages

```sh
tmpmail man | man -l -                     # read it now
tmpmail man -o ~/.local/share/man/man1     # install tmpmail.1 and tmpmail-COMMAND.1
```

| Option | Short | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| `--output DIR` | `-o` | Write one page per command into this folder instead of printing the main page. |

### `completions`: shell completion

```sh
tmpmail completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/tmpmail
tmpmail completions zsh  > ~/.zfunc/_tmpmail
tmpmail completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/tmpmail.fish
```

## Original tmpmail flags

These still work when used as the **first** argument, so old scripts keep running:

| Old | Same as |
|---|---|
| `tmpmail` | `tmpmail ls` |
| `tmpmail -g` / `--generate` | `tmpmail new` |
| `tmpmail -g name@domain` | `tmpmail new name@domain` |
| `tmpmail -r` / `--recent` | `tmpmail read --recent` |
| `tmpmail ID` | `tmpmail read ID` |
| `tmpmail -t ID` / `--text` | `tmpmail read ID` (text is already the default) |
| `tmpmail -d` / `--domains` | `tmpmail domains` |
| `tmpmail -c` / `--copy` | `tmpmail copy` |
| `tmpmail -b w3m -r` | `tmpmail -b w3m read --recent` |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `TMPMAIL_PROVIDER` | Fallback order for `new`, comma-separated, e.g. `guerrilla,mailtm`. |
| `TMPMAIL_INBOX` | Default inbox, like `-i`. |
| `TMPMAIL_TIMEOUT` | Default `wait` timeout in seconds. |
| `TMPMAIL_POLL_INTERVAL` | Seconds between checks in `wait`/`watch`. |
| `TMPMAIL_PASSWORD` | Password for `new --password` / `login`. Keeps it out of your shell history. |
| `TMPMAIL_STATE_DIR` | Where inboxes are stored. Default `~/.local/state/tmpmail`. |
| `TMPMAIL_CONFIG` | Config file path. Default `~/.config/tmpmail/config.toml`. Unknown keys in it are ignored with a warning on stderr (not with `-q` or `--json`); a known key with a bad value is an error. tmpmail 0.2.0 and earlier refuse unknown config keys; 0.3.0 and later warn. |
| `TMPMAIL_DROPMAIL_TOKEN` | Your own DropMail API token, if DropMail asks for a captcha. |
| `TMPMAIL_PUSH` | `0` turns off push in `wait`/`watch` (see [`wait`](#wait-wait-for-a-message)). Default `1`. |
| `PAGER` | Pager for long messages in `read`, unless `pager` is set in the config. Default `less` (on Windows, printing directly when `less` isn't installed). |
| `TMPMAIL_HTTP_TIMEOUT` | Seconds before a single request to a provider gives up. Default 20, or `http_timeout` in the config file (new in 0.3.0). |
| `NO_COLOR` | Disable colors. |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Other error (e.g. cannot write a file) |
| 2 | `wait` / `otp --wait` timed out |
| 3 | Provider problem: unreachable, rate limited, login failed, bad response |
| 4 | Nothing found: no inbox yet, no such message, no code or link in the message |
| 64 | Wrong usage: bad option, or the provider doesn't support it |
| 141 | Output pipe closed early (e.g. `| head`); normal Unix behaviour |
